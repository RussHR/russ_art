# Repo for Russ's Art Portfolio

This is for me to maintain my art portfolio and learn Gulp.
It uses the [Gulp - Foundation 5 Template](https://git.anguiano.me/christian/gulp-foundation-5-template) by Christian Anguiano.

## Tasks
  * `gulp`: Default task that runs everything.

## Directory Structure

  * `assets/scss/main.scss`: Application styles go here.
  * `assets/scss/_settings.scss`: Configure Foundation settings here.
  * `Build/`: compiled versions of Jade and Sass go here.
