# Repo for Russ's Art Portfolio

This is for me to maintain my art portfolio and learn Gulp.

## Tasks
  * `gulp`: Default task that sets up the server.
  * `gulp serve`: This preprocesses everything and sets up the server

## Directory Structure

  * `app/`: Application everything goes here before compiling.
  * `./`: Files go into root because github pages

## Other notes

  * hi! stand up for what's right!
